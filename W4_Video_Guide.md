### PART 1: Show the Basic Game (20 seconds)

**DO:**

- Open your browser to `https://localhost:5001/connectfour`
- Show the game board

**SAY:**
"Here's my Connect Four game. It has a game board where players can click columns to drop their colored pieces. Red goes first, then Yellow takes a turn. The first player to connect four pieces in a row wins!"

---

### PART 2: Demonstrate Feature #1 - Win Tracker (30 seconds)

**DO:**

- Point to the Win Tracker box at the top
- Play a quick game and win (have moves planned ahead)
- Show how the win count increases

**SAY:**
"My FIRST extra feature is called the **Win Tracker**. See this box at the top? It keeps track of how many games each player has won. Watch what happens when Red wins this game..."

_(Play and win)_

"See? Red's number went from 0 to 1! This is super helpful because it remembers all your wins during your gaming session. If I play another game and Yellow wins, Yellow's number will go up too!"

---

### PART 3: Demonstrate Feature #2 - Move History (30 seconds)

**DO:**

- Point to the Move History section at the bottom
- Make a few moves
- Scroll through the history list

**SAY:**
"My SECOND extra feature is the **Move History**. This is like a diary that writes down every single move in the game. See this list at the bottom? Every time someone plays, it adds a new line showing which player played and which column they chose."

_(Make moves)_

"Look! It says 'Red plays column 4' and 'Yellow plays column 3'. This is really helpful if you want to remember what happened or if you're learning strategy!"

---

### PART 4: Show New Game Button (20 seconds)

**DO:**

- Click "New Game" button
- Show that history clears but win tracker stays

**SAY:**
"When I click 'New Game', the board and move history clear out, but notice - the Win Tracker still remembers our scores! That way we can play multiple games and keep track of who's winning overall."

---

### PART 5: Show Reset Stats Button (15 seconds)

**DO:**

- Click "Reset Win Stats" button
- Show everything resets

**SAY:**
"If we want to start completely fresh with new scores, we click 'Reset Win Stats' and everything goes back to zero. Now we can start a brand new tournament!"
